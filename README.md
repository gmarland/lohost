## What is lohost?
Simply put, lohost is a way to serve a website to the internet from any local computer where you install the lohost website client.

You keep all the files on your local computer and pick the subdomain where the website lives: (https://{yourApp}.lohost.io).

## Getting started
Download the website client installer from this page and install it on your computer (currently windows only sorry). IMPORTANT, You will need to unblock the setup.exe once downloaded or it will not run.

Pick a location to install lohost and once installed, run the .exe through a command prompt. This will assign you a random lohost url and run the default website from your computer.
